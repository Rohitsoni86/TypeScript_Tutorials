# TypeScript_Tutorials

This is a easy and understandable tutorial for using Typescript

TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript

# What do you use TypeScript for?

📍 Boolean Static typing

📍 Type Inference ⭐⭐

📍 Strict Null Checking ⭐⭐

# Things To Remember

⭐==> Browser does not supports typescript it will be compiles the typescript ====> javascript.

⭐==> All Types declared in typescript are always in LOWERCASE only.

⭐==> Any is not a type in Typescript (It is include in the type definations) "It must be used only when Type checking is not considered".

⭐==> By default null and undefined are subtypes of all other types.

⭐==> Null type is Object type and Undefinded is An Undefined only.

⭐==> Never is used when we dont want to declare any explicit return specially for Functions.

⭐==> Always use Void for functions which has no returns.

⭐==> Enum is a feature in TypeScript that allows you to define a set of named constants..

⭐==> TypeScript translates an enum to a corresponding IIFE which then introduces into runtime a JavaScript object representation of the enum

⭐==> Type Narrowing == > Automatically refines the type of a variable within a specific block of code

# Best Practices For Type-Script

📍 Use Strict Type Checking

📍 Prefer const and let Over var

📍 Explicitly Define any Types

📍 Prefer Type Inference Over Explicit Types

📍 Use interface for Object Shape Definitions and type for Complex Types

📍 Use readonly for Immutable Data

📍 Type Guards for Handling null or undefined

📍 Use Strict Type Checking
