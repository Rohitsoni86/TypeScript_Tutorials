//  What is TypeScript ?

// Next.js is an open-source framework designed to work with React. It is used to build landing pages, SEO-friendly websites, eCommerce stores, and all kinds of web applications that need fast, high-performance load times. On the other hand, TypeScript is a programming language built on JavaScript, which Next.js supports. These two combined provide a better experience both for the user and for the developer.

// What is TypeScript?

// TypeScript is a programming language that is developed and maintained by Microsoft, and it is a strict superset of JavaScript. It supports static and dynamic typing, and further provides inheritance features, classes, visibility scopes, namespaces, interfaces, unions, and other modern features. TS was designed to handle larger projects as it’s easier to refactor code. Learn more about its features with an in-depth comparison with JavaScript.

// ✨ Developed by Microsoft: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript.
// ✨ Static Typing: Adds optional static types for better error detection and safer code.
// ✨ Modern Features: Supports classes, interfaces, inheritance, namespaces, and unions.
// ✨ Improved Code Maintainability: Easier refactoring and debugging for large projects.
// ✨ Compilation to JavaScript: TypeScript code compiles down to JavaScript for browser and runtime compatibility.
// ✨ Better Tooling: Provides enhanced code completion, linting, and debugging support.
// ✨ Ideal for Large Projects: Simplifies managing complex codebases with improved structure and type safety.

// What do you use TypeScript for?

// Using new features of ECMAScript
// ⭐⭐ Static typing ⭐⭐ - JavaScript is a dynamical type and it does not know what type of variable is until it is actually instantiated at runtime; here, TypeScript adds type support to the JavaScript.

// ⭐⭐ Type Inference ⭐⭐ - TypeScript makes typing a little bit easier and a lot less explicit by the usage of type inference.

// ⭐⭐ Strict Null Checking ⭐⭐

//  TypeScript is closely related to JavaScript so it has great interoperability capabilities, but some extra work is required to work with the JavaScript libraries in TypeScript.

// ⭐⭐ TypeScript cathes errors at compile time instead of runtime,which makes debugging easier and reduces the likelihood of bugs in production

// TODO: ✨ Browser does not supports it it will be compiles the typescript ====> javascript
